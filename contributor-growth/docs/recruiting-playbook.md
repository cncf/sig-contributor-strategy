Recruiting Contributors
*Status: Draft; Missing Components*
/help-wanted

# Summary 

Recruiting and retention go hand in hand. If you are thinking "how can we add more amazing contributors?" and "where do we find them?" the projects leadership needs to think about how you keep folks around, too. If your goal is to limit to only single contributions aka drive-bys then this might not apply to you. But once you open the gates to more contributors of any type, balancing maintainers time becomes the next challenge. This is why it's important to think of recruiting and retention initiatives together rather than separate. 

For the purpose of this document, we will dig into the how and where to do outreach [TODO other retention related docs and info; contributor ladder]

# Who
Outreach depends on your audience, how they consume information, and their motivations to help an open source project.  [TODO add much more about motivations of people doing open source - maybe cncf survey related]

1. Downstream community members
   [TODO add more here, motivations, where to reach, etc]
   - Companies using your project
   - Individuals
   - CNCF End User Committee 
2. Ecosystem (and dependency) contributors and maintainers
   [TODO add more here, motivations, where to reach, etc]
   - People who build on top of, with, for extendability and any other reason
3. Academia - students, professors/administrators, scientists, interns
   [TODO add more here, motivations, where to reach, etc]
4. Individuals interested in contributing to open source with no familiarity with the project or dependencies. 
5. Anyone else? 

# Where
Always be recruiting. Think of ways to always promote your needs and areas of growth for the project anytime you have a chance. Be as specific as you can when you are communicating though. The more ambiguous it sounds, the less likely someone is to check it out or take interest. Talk about roles (example: reviewers in a certain area/subject, community managers, project managers, go developers) and provide any kind of guides, role descriptions, contributor ladders as you have. The more of these documents that you have available in your project repository the easier it will be for you in explaining how your project works to potential new contributors. 

General areas with specifics below:
- your repo via labels, issues calling out help wanted areas, project boards, and other organization
- a contributor site/area of the project site for contributors
- mailing list adverts and promotions (weekly help wanted?)
- in-person or virtual talks and workshops about the project
- section during community meeting 
- project twitter announcements 

# Specific Projects & Programs 

## Contributor Documentation
Contributor Guide (for all contributors)
[TODO include recommendations and links]
Developer Guide (deep dive for developers)
[TODO include recommendations and links]


## Issue and PR Triage strategy 
This is the first thing new contributors will see after some kind of interest in your project.
Good first issues
Help Wanted
Be kind.
In triage and anywhere in your community. if folks are coming around to file issues and submit one-off PRs, being kind can help them want to do it again the next time they think about it. Saying please, thank you, and welcome never hurts. 


## New Contributor Workshops
[TODO add summary]

### At targeted events
[TODO - add example links to documentation and sites, etc]

### Online 
[TODO - expland]

* Code walk through videos.
* Links to talks in conferences.
* Links to presentations/meetups.

## Contributor Playground
This can be paired with the workshop or on its own for people to try, get used to the CI, build system, ownership model, etc. 
[TODO add examples]

## AMAs / Office Hours / Meet the Maintainers
Different topics of live questions can help grow your community, mentor at scale, and provide technical assistance when people really want to talk to a human. No matter the topic, this can help recruit contributors, too, depending on how you position it. 
Example: technical office hours can bring new use cases and validating current ones - you can ask people to file issues, PRs, or come to additional meetings to help out. 
Meet the maintainers
[TODO - add example links to documentation and sites, etc.]

## Build a community, outreach, contributor, or related team or hire a community manager
Create the intentional space for this work to always be accuring if your project has goals of becoming a contributor community (have many contributors). [TODO paris is working on this in a separate thread]

## Internships

GSOC
Outreachy
CommunityBridge
[TODO - what else? link all docs here and examples of other projects involvement] 

## Open Source Hackathons

Hacktoberfest
[TODO others and examples]

## [TODO add more]
